# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my AI & Machine Learning Module Assignment 1 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of training supervised regression models to predict the price of a pc based on specs like gpu model, cpu model, monitor size, etc.

- `data` contains the tabular dataset for the pc specs
- `regression.ipynb` contains code for the entire modelling process documented with markdown comments
